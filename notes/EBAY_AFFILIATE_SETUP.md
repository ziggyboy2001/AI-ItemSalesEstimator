# eBay Affiliate Setup Guide

## Overview

The EbayLinkButton component automatically generates affiliate links for current eBay listings, allowing you to earn 1-4% commission on purchases made through your app.

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# eBay Partner Network (EPN) Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_EBAY_PARTNER_ID=your_partner_id_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_EBAY_CAMPAIGN_ID=your_campaign_id_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_EBAY_AFFILIATE_ENABLED=true
```

## How to Get eBay Partner Network Credentials

1. **Sign Up**: Visit [https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/](https://partnernetwork.ebay.com/)
2. **Apply**: Complete the application process (usually approved within 24-48 hours)
3. **Get Credentials**:
   - Partner ID: Found in your EPN dashboard
   - Campaign ID: Create a campaign and use its ID

## How It Works

- **Current Listings**: Button shows "Buy on eBay" and wraps the URL with your affiliate parameters
- **Sold Items**: Button shows "View on eBay" and uses direct links (no affiliate possible)
- **Fallback**: If affiliate credentials are missing, uses direct links automatically

## Commission Rates

- **Motors**: 1%
- **Electronics, Computers**: 2-4%
- **Fashion, Home & Garden**: 3-8%
- **Other Categories**: 1-4%

## Technical Details

- Uses eBay's rover.ebay.com affiliate link format
- Automatically extracts item IDs from URLs
- Includes custom tracking ID: "bidpeek_app"
- Safe fallback to direct links if affiliate setup fails

## Testing

To test affiliate functionality:

1. Add your credentials to `.env`
2. Search for current listings
3. Click "Buy on eBay" button
4. Check console logs for affiliate URL generation
5. Verify purchases in your EPN dashboard (24-48 hour delay)

## Revenue Sharing Note

You earn commission on all purchases made through affiliate links generated by your app. This is a legitimate way to monetize your eBay integration.
